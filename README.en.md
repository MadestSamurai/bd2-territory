A standalone Fantasia Territory assistant for BrownDust II on Windows. Automate mining, logging, recipe-based planting and harvesting, with optional cooking and layout preview, purchasing and import.

## Sell surplus stock

Enable **Sell excess automatically**, choose the quantity to keep per item (100–9900, default 9900), then start automation. Only the excess is sold; stock exactly at the threshold is retained. Selling can run on its own.

Only territory materials, produce and meals explicitly listed by the game's territory shop are eligible. Locked items, buildings, decorations, equipment and attribute stones are excluded. Automatic cooking takes priority. Each batch waits for confirmation; the UI shows confirmed sales and territory currency earned. Disabled by default.

If a network interruption leaves the outcome unknown, the tool pauses and preserves the record without resubmitting. Check the game inventory and logs. Thresholds, categories, locks, duplicate replies and current-client interface compilation have been checked; live selling has not been exercised for this release.

## Download

Current version: **0.3.10-beta.1**. One application includes Simplified Chinese and English. Start with a small planting budget and cooking batch when evaluating this beta.

| Edition | Runtime | Recommended for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Portable** | Includes .NET; no separate installation | Most users |
| **Lite** | Requires [.NET Desktop Runtime 8 x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) | Users with the desktop runtime who prefer a smaller download |

Windows x64 only. Both editions have the same features. Each EXE works on its own; ZIP files include bilingual documentation and licenses. Verify downloads with `SHA256SUMS.txt`. No Python, .NET SDK or other BD2 tools are required. Lite needs **Desktop Runtime**, not just the regular .NET Runtime.

## Quick start

1. Start the game and enter your own Fantasia Territory. Keep one game instance and use the same Windows privileges for both programs.
2. Select **Connect / update** and wait for “Territory detected”.
3. Choose activities and a recipe. The list shows **actual dish names and ingredient ratios**; unavailable recipes explain why they are locked.
4. Set the planting budget and select **Start automation**. Defaults: budget 1400, interval 500ms. A budget of 0 is unlimited.
5. Select **Pause** or close the tool to stop further operations. Submitted actions still finish normally.

To update from the private territory 0.2.0 tool, pause the old tool before connecting; the game can stay open. Switching from another standalone tool or the private workbench requires a normal game restart. Opening the EXE does not connect or start automation.

## Features and settings

| Setting / feature | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Mining and logging | Gather only mature resources; failed targets remain in a retry queue |
| Farming | Plant actual native preview groups, including smaller or disconnected fields; balance stock and expected growing yield against recipe requirements |
| Recipes | Read current names, ingredients, seeds and unlock status; changes wait for the current planting batch |
| Default recipe | Energizing Gnocchi, using a 5:3:2 ratio; the displayed name follows the game translation |
| Automatic cooking | Off by default. Uses existing ingredients for the selected dish. Batch limit: 1–1000, default 100. Other activities continue when ingredients or output capacity are insufficient |
| Movement | A* grid routing by default; predicts traversal using the game controller’s collision, step and slope settings, then uses directional movement. Vehicles and recovery dashes remain available |
| Use game NavMesh navigation | Optional and off by default. Turning off switches to A* immediately; turning on applies to the next route. The preference is saved |
| Action interval | 100–60000ms, default 500; still waits for animations, loading and server responses |
| Planting budget | Resets on each new run. Gathering continues when spent. Only planting uses this budget; cooking consumes existing ingredients |
| Layouts | Farm, mining and logging templates or JSON import. Preview placement and cost, then explicitly purchase and import |

New installs and upgrades without a saved navigation preference default to NavMesh off. If A* cannot find a route, the target remains queued for retry; NavMesh is never enabled automatically. Water is impassable except through existing bridges; detours, movement trials and recovery dashes all follow this rule. NPCs and workers no longer receive synthetic obstacle footprints. Prediction uses effective game collisions; uncertain routes can be tested by ordinary movement and are temporarily excluded only after 3 seconds without progress.

Cooking does not buy ingredients, sell items or switch dishes. Unknown results keep their journal and pause further operations to avoid duplicate consumption. Check inventory and diagnostics; do not delete records to blindly retry.

## Fixed crop planting and navigation

Under **Planting and cooking**, choose **Balance a recipe** or **Plant a fixed crop**. Connect to load crop names and unlock status, then choose the crop to keep planting in actual native batches. Changes wait for the current planting transaction to finish; budgets and batch progress are preserved. Automatic cooking has its own recipe selection and remains optional.

A* refines narrow passages when the coarse grid fails. Ground checks and discovered routes are cached and warmed incrementally while idle; upcoming edges are checked live. Scene, layout, character and local resource changes invalidate the relevant cache. NavMesh remains optional and off by default.

## Disconnected fields and recipe balance

No layout change or 100-field farm is required. The tool visits available field areas and confirms each actual native batch before moving on. Smaller groups and single isolated fields are supported. If the game previews several areas together, they are submitted together.

Each native batch uses one crop to reduce interactions. Recipe balance uses inventory plus the expected yield of growing crops. A 5:3:2 ratio targets ingredient output over repeated batches, not an exact split within every field group. Stock, growth times and yield affect the next crop. Charges use the actual field count; unaffordable groups are deferred while other eligible fields and gathering continue. Fixed-crop planting also supports scattered fields.

Existing completed or pending planting journals are retained on upgrade. Offline regressions and client interface checks cover this change; continuous planting on scattered fields still needs live verification.

## Layout tools

Pause automation and open **Layouts**. Choose an area and template or load a file. Select **Preview layout and cost**, review the quote, then **Purchase and import**.

Existing facilities are reused and moved first; only missing items are purchased. Decorations use normal game prices, buildings use owned materials, and crafted furniture must already be owned. Other buildings, workers and crops are preserved. No land purchases or demolition. Clear occupied destinations first. A backup is saved before import; each placement waits for confirmation.

**Export current territory** saves editable facility positions without account or worker identities. Layouts require the same terrain and unlocked areas.

## Language

First launch follows the system language. The top-right switch is saved separately and does not start, stop or reconfigure automation. Dish, crop and facility names follow the game language. Raw logs and low-level exceptions retain their original text.

## Compatibility and limits

The tool reads local client interfaces and generates an adapter when connecting, without locking to a release-date client version. Incompatible changes stop connection; compatibility with every future version is not guaranteed.

No game DLLs, data tables, images, account data or private layouts are included. Building requires no game installation. Connecting requires the official Windows client, not an Android emulator.

## Diagnostics and feedback

Open **Connection and diagnostics**. Local data is stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BD2Territory` and is not uploaded. It includes settings, account progress, cooking journals, layout backups and obstacle snapshots.

Report the version, error text and reproduction steps. Share relevant logs only, never credentials or complete game resources. Keep the first connection error instead of repeatedly reconnecting.
